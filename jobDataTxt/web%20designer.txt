Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.\n\nAbout The Team\n\nWeb Presence and Platform is organized into two pillars, each of which is grouped into pods that focus on the central tenets of Stripe's public mission. The Presence pillar creates industry-leading designs for Stripe’s front door surfaces, educates customers about the power of our platform, and drives our business success. The Platform pillar builds the internal machinery that powers these surfaces, and is responsible for making our websites fast, stable, and easy to modify.\n\nTogether we design and build stripe.com and other sites that amount to what is, for many, their first impression of Stripe. As such, WPP offers exciting opportunities to have a major impact on Stripe’s success. We want to make every pixel count, we want it to be enthralling, and we want to help other Stripes seamlessly benefit from our systematic work.\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nAs a WPP Designer focused on events-related web experiences, you will enhance Stripe’s reach through thoughtful and expertly crafted event-related marketing sites, sign-up forms, and mobile apps.\n\nYour primary focus will be crafting visually compelling and user-friendly websites that drive sign-ups and overall engagement for key events like Stripe Sessions.

The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.\n\nMinimum Requirements\n• Has 5+ years relevant design experience at a tech, product-driven company, and/or agency with a focus on marketing websites and apps\n• Strong portfolio showcasing visually engaging web design work and delightful user interfaces\n• Can reduce complex problems down into pithy stories, delivered through interaction or animation\n• Proven record in strategic thinking and decision-making\n• Deep understanding of the principles of UX/UI design\n• Strong systems-thinking; able to extrapolate and extend shared patterns and behaviors\n• Meticulous attention to detail and strong problem-solving abilities\n• Expert understanding of the formal elements of design, not just limited to the web and including typography, layout, balance, and proportion\n• Excellent communication skills and ability to collaborate effectively in a cross-functional environment\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n• Thorough understanding of motion principles such as easing\n• Previous experience designing interactive experiences for events\n• Love working with other designers to help them learn and grow—and have them help you learn and grow\n\nHybrid work at Stripe\n\nThis role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).\n\nOffice-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.\n\nA remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.\n\nPay and benefits\n\nThe annual US base salary range for this role is $152,700 - $229,100. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.\n\nAdditional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.","location":"Toronto, ON, Canada","employmentType":"","datePosted":"26 days ago","salaryRange":"","jobProviders":[{"jobProvider":"LinkedIn","url":"https://ca.linkedin.com/jobs/view/designer-web-presence-events-at-stripe-4040513090?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic"},{"jobProvider":"Learn4Good","url":"https://www.learn4good.com/jobs/canada/info_technology/3723002133/e/?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic"},{"jobProvider":"Designer Fund Job Board","url":"https://jobs.designerfund.com/companies/stripe/jobs/40790174-designer-web-presence-events?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic"}]},{"id":"2_F5tlkmtQrsYeE-AAAAAA==","title":"Web designer - graphic design","company":"RIGHTMOVE DESIGN INC","description":"Education: Secondary (high) school graduation certificate.
