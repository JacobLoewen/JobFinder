            "description": "Who we are\n\nAbout Stripe\n\nStripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world\u2019s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.\n\nAbout The Team\n\nWeb Presence and Platform is organized into two pillars, each of which is grouped into pods that focus on the central tenets of Stripe's public mission. The Presence pillar creates industry-leading designs for Stripe\u2019s front door surfaces, educates customers about the power of our platform, and drives our business success. The Platform pillar builds the internal machinery that powers these surfaces, and is responsible for making our websites fast, stable, and easy to modify.\n\nTogether we design and build stripe.com and other sites that amount to what is, for many, their first impression of Stripe. As such, WPP offers exciting opportunities to have a major impact on Stripe\u2019s success. We want to make every pixel count, we want it to be enthralling, and we want to help other Stripes seamlessly benefit from our systematic work.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll do\n\nAs a WPP Designer focused on events-related web experiences, you will enhance Stripe\u2019s reach through thoughtful and expertly crafted event-related marketing sites, sign-up forms, and mobile apps.\n\nYour primary focus will be crafting visually compelling and user-friendly websites that drive sign-ups and overall engagement for key events like Stripe Sessions. Through collaboration with Event Marketing, Brand Studio's Experiential team, and Design Engineers, you'll ensure that designs align with event-related business goals while providing significant value and delight to users.\n\nOperating in a fast-paced environment, you'll leverage your visual and UX expertise to design intuitive experiences, ensuring they meet Stripe's high quality standards. Your role will seamlessly blend visual creativity, user experience principles, and a meticulous attention to detail to create best-in-class design solutions.\n\nResponsibilities\n\u2022 Design event-related websites, landing pages, and mobile apps\n\u2022 Create visually engaging and user-friendly designs that align with Stripe\u2019s brand standards\n\u2022 Collaborate with event marketing to ensure interactive content meets business objectives and user needs\n\u2022 Attune and optimize event-specific brand identities and integrate them into scalable UI design systems\n\u2022 Collaborate with design engineers on creative interactive prototypes and concepts\n\u2022 Rigorously QA builds before going into production\n\nWho you are\n\nWe're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.\n\nMinimum Requirements\n\u2022 Has 5+ years relevant design experience at a tech, product-driven company, and/or agency with a focus on marketing websites and apps\n\u2022 Strong portfolio showcasing visually engaging web design work and delightful user interfaces\n\u2022 Can reduce complex problems down into pithy stories, delivered through interaction or animation\n\u2022 Proven record in strategic thinking and decision-making\n\u2022 Deep understanding of the principles of UX/UI design\n\u2022 Strong systems-thinking; able to extrapolate and extend shared patterns and behaviors\n\u2022 Meticulous attention to detail and strong problem-solving abilities\n\u2022 Expert understanding of the formal elements of design, not just limited to the web and including typography, layout, balance, and proportion\n\u2022 Excellent communication skills and ability to collaborate effectively in a cross-functional environment\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n\u2022 Thorough understanding of motion principles such as easing\n\u2022 Previous experience designing interactive experiences for events\n\u2022 Love working with other designers to help them learn and grow\u2014and have them help you learn and grow\n\nHybrid work at Stripe\n\nThis role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).\n\nOffice-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.\n\nA remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.\n\nPay and benefits\n\nThe annual US base salary range for this role is $152,700 - $229,100. For sales roles, the range provided is the role\u2019s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate\u2019s experience, qualifications, and location.
